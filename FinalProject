## Do New York City Public Schools properly prepare students for the SAT?

- Most colleges across the United States require or at least "recommend" taking the SAT for admission into their school. 

- For this analysis, we will take a look at the performance of students who attended NYC Public Schools and took the SAT in 2012. 

- Using a sample size of 421 schools, we will dive into the performance of high schools across our 5 boroughs. 

##Questions and Hypothesis
-Do NYC public High schools prepare students to attend CUNY's four year colleges?

-Which borough prepared its students the most, and which borough prepared its students the least for colleges?

-Are students do well in SAT math portion also do well on overall scores?

-Is there any ability gap between math and reading?

Total Average SAT scores of NYC
```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(total.avg,conf.level=.95)  #### 95% of total SAT mean=(802.9055 825.4318), based on the result most are unable to attend most CUNY Schools except Medgar Evers. Results are generated from a t distribution test with 95% of confidence interval. We use a t test becuase the variance of the population is unknown.

##Conclusion 
The average SAT scores for NYC Public schools fall between 802.9 and 825.4.

Based on the average scores, NYC Public schools do not prepare students to attend most of the CUNY Colleges, but they are able to get accepted into Medgar Evers College. 

The schools in Staten Island have the highest average SAT score, and schools in The Bronx have the lowest average SAT score.

Most students in Brooklyn and Bronx are not able to go to CUNY¡¯s four year colleges due to low SAT test scores.

Students who did well on the SAT Math portion, also did well on overall scores.

Most students'SAT math scores is slightly higher than reading scores.
